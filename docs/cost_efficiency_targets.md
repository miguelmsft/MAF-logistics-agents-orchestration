# Zava Logistics Cost Efficiency Targets - Q1 2026

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the cost efficiency targets and optimization priorities for Q1 2026. All capacity planning decisions should consider these targets while maintaining service quality.

## Key Performance Indicators

### Current Performance vs Targets

| Metric | Q4 2025 Actual | Q1 2026 Target | Gap |
|--------|----------------|----------------|-----|
| Cost per kg shipped | $0.48 | $0.45 | -$0.03 |
| Fuel efficiency (L/kg) | 0.27 | 0.25 | -0.02 |
| On-time delivery rate | 97.2% | 98.5% | +1.3% |
| Aircraft utilization | 78% | 82% | +4% |
| Load factor (average) | 76% | 80% | +4% |

### Monthly Targets

| Month | Cost/kg | On-Time % | Load Factor |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| January 2026 | $0.47 | 98.0% | 78% |
| February 2026 | $0.46 | 98.3% | 80% |
| March 2026 | $0.45 | 98.5% | 82% |

## Route Optimization Priorities

### Tier 1: High Priority Optimization

#### LAX-JFK
- **Status**: Highest margin route
- **Priority**: Maximize load factor
- **Target**: 85% average load factor
- **Action**: Prefer adding packages to existing flights over adding flights
- **Cost Impact**: Each 1% load factor improvement = $12,000/month savings

#### ORD-MIA
- **Status**: Best fuel efficiency in network
- **Priority**: Use for overflow from other routes when possible
- **Target**: 80% load factor
- **Action**: Consider as primary overflow destination
- **Cost Impact**: 15% lower fuel cost per kg than network average

### Tier 2: Monitor and Optimize

#### SEA-DFW
- **Status**: Underutilized
- **Current Load Factor**: 68%
- **Target**: 75% or consolidate
- **Action**: If below 60% for 2+ weeks, consider schedule reduction
- **Risk**: Growing tech corridor - don't reduce capacity prematurely

#### DEN-ATL
- **Status**: Growing demand
- **Current Load Factor**: 72%
- **Target**: 78%
- **Action**: Monitor for potential frequency increase in Q2
- **Opportunity**: Fastest growing route - position for expansion

## Cost Reduction Initiatives

### 1. Flight Consolidation

**Goal**: Reduce flights with <65% load factor

| Action | Savings Potential | Implementation |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Consolidate low-volume days | $45,000/month | Immediate |
| Optimize departure times | $20,000/month | 2 weeks |
| Coordinate with partner carriers | $30,000/month | 1 month |

### 2. Fuel Optimization

**Goal**: Reduce fuel consumption by 8%

| Action | Savings Potential | Implementation |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Optimal altitude routing | $35,000/month | Immediate |
| Reduced taxi time | $15,000/month | Coordinate with airports |
| Weight reduction program | $25,000/month | Ongoing |

### 3. Charter Avoidance

**Goal**: Reduce charter flights by 50%

- Charter cost: 1.5x standard rate
- Q4 2025 charter spend: $180,000
- Q1 2026 target: $90,000

**Strategies**:
- Better demand forecasting
- Pre-positioned capacity for known peaks
- Partner carrier agreements for overflow

## Capacity Decision Framework

When evaluating capacity changes, use this ROI framework:

### Adding Capacity

```
Break-even Load Factor = Fixed Costs / (Revenue per kg - Variable Cost per kg)

Example for additional LAX-JFK flight:
- Fixed Cost (flight): $28,000
- Revenue per kg: $0.85
- Variable Cost per kg: $0.35
- Break-even: $28,000 / ($0.85 - $0.35) = 56,000 kg
- Break-even Load Factor: 56,000 / 52,000 = 108% (not viable as regular flight)
- Conclusion: Only add if temporary surge justifies premium pricing
```

### Charter Decision

```
Charter ROI = (Overflow Revenue - Charter Cost) / Charter Cost

Example:
- Overflow packages: 15,000 packages @ 3.6 kg = 54,000 kg
- Revenue: 54,000 kg x $0.85 = $45,900
- Charter cost: $42,000
- ROI: ($45,900 - $42,000) / $42,000 = 9.3%

Decision: Marginal - only proceed if customer retention value is high
```

## Budget Allocation

### Q1 2026 Capacity Budget

| Category | Budget | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Regular Operations | $2.4M/month | Base flight operations |
| Capacity Buffer | $180K/month | 15% buffer for demand spikes |
| Charter Contingency | $90K/quarter | Emergency charter fund |
| Optimization Projects | $50K/quarter | Efficiency improvements |

## Reporting Requirements

| Report | Frequency | Owner |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Daily Cost Dashboard | Daily | Operations |
| Route Profitability | Weekly | Finance |
| Efficiency Scorecard | Monthly | Director |
| Quarterly Business Review | Quarterly | VP |
