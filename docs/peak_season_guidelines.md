## Historical Performance

### Valentine's Day 2025 Results

| Metric | Forecast | Actual | Variance |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| Total Volume | +28% | +31% | +3% |

| Charter Flights Used | 1 | 2 | +1 |
| On-Time Delivery | 96% | 93% | -3% |
| Customer Complaints | 45 | 78 | +73% |

### Lessons Learned from 2025

1. **Underestimated LAX-JFK demand**: Add 5% buffer to forecasts
2. **Late charter approval**: Pre-approve charter authority for peaks
3. **Ground crew bottleneck at JFK**: Add temporary staff earlier
4. **Customer communication gap**: Proactive delay notifications needed

## Peak Period Staffing

| Role | Normal | Peak Period |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Flight Crews | Standard rotation | Extended hours approved |
| Ground Crews | 2 per shift | 3-4 per shift |
| Operations Center | 8 staff | 12 staff (24/7) |
| Customer Service | Normal | +50% phone staff |

## Emergency Procedures

If demand exceeds 100% of planned capacity:

1. **Immediate**: Activate charter standby
2. **Within 2 hours**: Customer notification of potential delays
3. **Within 4 hours**: Implement priority shipping tiers
4. **Within 8 hours**: Executive briefing on capacity status
