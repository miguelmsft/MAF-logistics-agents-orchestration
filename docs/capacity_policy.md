# Zava Logistics Capacity Planning Policy

## Purpose

This document establishes the policies and procedures for capacity planning at Zava Logistics. All capacity decisions must align with these guidelines to ensure operational efficiency, cost control, and service quality.

## Planning Principles

### 1. Forecast Horizon

- **Minimum**: Plan capacity 30 days ahead
- **Recommended**: 60-day rolling forecast
- **Strategic**: 90-day outlook for major decisions

### 2. Buffer Requirement

- Maintain **15% capacity buffer** above forecasted demand
- Buffer ensures ability to handle unexpected volume spikes
- Buffer should be calculated per route, not system-wide

### 3. Cost Hierarchy

When addressing capacity needs, prefer options in this order:
1. Optimize existing flight schedules (lowest cost)
2. Increase flight frequency on existing routes
3. Cross-route load balancing
4. Charter flights (highest cost, last resort)

## Approval Thresholds

| Change Type | Approval Required | Lead Time |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Schedule optimization | Operations Team | 24 hours |
| +1 daily flight (temporary) | Operations Manager | 48 hours |
| +1 daily flight (permanent) | Director of Operations | 2 weeks |
| Charter flight | Director approval + Finance review | 24-48 hours |
| New route | VP of Operations | 90 days |
| Fleet expansion | Executive Committee | 6 months |

## Load Factor Guidelines

### Action Triggers

| Load Factor | Status | Required Action |
|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| Below 50% | Critical Low | Immediate review, consider route suspension |
| 50-65% | Warning | Consolidate flights, adjust schedule |
| 65-80% | Optimal | No action required |
| 80-85% | High Optimal | Monitor closely |
| 85-90% | Elevated | Begin capacity expansion planning |
| 90-95% | High | Implement expansion within 1 week |
| Above 95% | Critical High | Immediate action required (24-48 hrs) |

### Calculating Load Factor

```
Load Factor = (Actual Weight Shipped / Aircraft Capacity) x 100

Example:
- Aircraft Capacity: 52,000 kg
- Packages Shipped: 12,000 packages
- Average Package Weight: 3.6 kg
- Total Weight: 43,200 kg
- Load Factor: 43,200 / 52,000 = 83%
```

## Peak Period Management

### Definition of Peak Period

A peak period is declared when:
- Forecasted demand exceeds 90% of capacity for 3+ consecutive days
- OR single-day demand exceeds 95% of capacity

### Peak Period Procedures

1. **Identification**: Forecast team identifies peak 14+ days in advance
2. **Planning**: Capacity plan submitted to Operations Manager
3. **Pre-positioning**: Extra capacity arranged 3-5 days before peak
4. **Execution**: Daily monitoring during peak period
5. **Review**: Post-peak analysis within 1 week

## Overflow Handling

When demand exceeds capacity:

1. **Priority 1**: Next-day guaranteed shipments
2. **Priority 2**: Standard shipments by booking date
3. **Priority 3**: Economy shipments

Overflow options:
- Route to partner carriers (pre-negotiated rates)
- Charter flights (requires Director approval)
- Customer communication for delayed shipments

## Reporting Requirements

| Report | Frequency | Audience |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Daily Capacity Utilization | Daily | Operations Team |
| Weekly Forecast vs Actual | Weekly | Operations Manager |
| Monthly Capacity Analysis | Monthly | Director of Operations |
| Quarterly Planning Review | Quarterly | VP of Operations |

## Policy Exceptions

Exceptions to this policy require:
- Written justification
- Approval from Director of Operations or higher
- Documentation in the Capacity Planning Log
